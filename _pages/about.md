Finally, I have my personal website after several years of procrastination! I would like to say thank you to my friend, Pontus Holma, for introducing me to this awesome tool. This website is still underconstruction. I write this start page very quickly because I don't want to leave the template text to be here for too long.

Hello everyone! My name is Sivakorn Lerttripinyo, but you can just call me with my nickname <b>"Mil"</b>. Apart from visiting official place, no one in Thailand calls each other with their first name. You may wonder how we (Thai people) choose our nickname. The answer is "Just randomly pick any word"! So, you can normally meet Thai people with the nickname such as "Best", "Ball", "Earth", etc. Don't be surprised!

For any Swedes here, I know that "en/flera mil" means "one/several 10 kilometers". Some feel weird with my nickname, but I don't really want to change it or use another name. Thanks for your understanding!

I am currently a second-year master student in Computer Science at Uppsala Univeristy, Sweden. My CS program allows me to choose the track(s) after being admitted to the program. After I have changed my plan so many times before starting my first semester, I finally decide to pursue a "programming language" and a "concurrency and parallelism" track. These are some (chosen to be listed here) courses I have taken.
- [Functional Programming I](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL330) and [Advanced Functional Programming](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL450)
- [Semantics of Programming Languages](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL311)
- [Low-Level Parallel Programming](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DT116)
- [Advanced Computer Architecture](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DT024)
- [Data Engineering I](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD169) and [Data Engineering II](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD076)

My Former Study
==========================
I hold a bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. This degree is an integration program between a computer and an electrical engineering focusing on a communication and network system. These are some (chosen to be listed here) courses I have taken.
- Principle of Data Communication
- Netcentric Architecture
- Ubiquitous Computing
- Teletraffic Engineering and Network Optimization

I also took some courses relating to Software Engineering and Data Science.
- Software Engineering
- Database Systems
- Data Warehousing
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Data Structure and Algorithm

My bachelor thesis topic is "Machine Learning for Financial Market". You can read its detail in the [portfolio](/portfolio/) page, which is also still underconstruction. Fortunately, you can read my [thesis defense's slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBXmJiB0K7qM4DEo7563skMKwUgrEpkB/view) while you are waiting for that page to be written.

My Other Interests
==========================
I also have an interest in human behavior and psychology. I took two psychology courses during my bachelor as general education courses. One is about the social psychology, and another is about the psychology to improve our work and study life. During my free time, I also read non-fiction books on this topic, such as "Thinking Fast and Slow" (such a classical book) and "Think Like a Freak".

I am also studying Swedish language as well. To be honest, I am not that good language learner, but I am currently trying my best. Some of my friends ask me why I learn this language. Well, I now live in Sweden, so I guess I should, isn't it? I don't want to always use a Google Translate in my daily life, but it appears that I still always use it because there are still a lot of words I don't know. I have already finished two basic Swedish courses offered by Uppsala University. De säger att min språknivå är A2, men jag förstår fortfarande inte talad svenska. Den är för snabb. I am currently trying to watch [Bäst i Test](https://www.tv4play.se/program/656771bf6316036b7178/bast-i-test) with a Swedish subtitle. Well, not that bad, I would say!

I want to add some more things to this part, but I am too tired now.


<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting -->
